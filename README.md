# Friend-Finder
Week 13 Homework - Working with Node and Express Servers

In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I use Express to handle routing: this is also the first project we deploy to Heroku.
